# Rock Paper Scissors

## Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to simulate the classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors." The program will allow a player to input their choice via the console (either `"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"`) and then compete against the program, which will randomly choose its move. The result will determine whether the player wins, loses, or ties based on the standard rules of the game.

## Rules of the Game

1. **Rock** beats **Scissors**.
2. **Scissors** beats **Paper**.
3. **Paper** beats **Rock**.
4. If both the player and the program choose the same option, it results in a **tie**.

## Implementation Details

- The program will:
  1. Prompt the player to enter their choice (`"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"`) via the console.
  2. Randomly generate the program's choice (`"rock"`, `"paper"`, or `"scissors"`).
  3. Compare the player's choice and the program's choice to determine the result.
  4. Display the outcome in the console:
     - `"Player Won"` if the player wins.
     - `"Player Lost"` if the program wins.
     - `"It's a Tie"` if both choices are the same.

## Additional Notes

- Ensure input validation to handle cases where the player provides invalid input.
- You can extend this project with features like:
  - Keeping score across multiple rounds.
  - Allowing the player to quit after a certain number of rounds.
  - Adding a graphical or text-based UI.
