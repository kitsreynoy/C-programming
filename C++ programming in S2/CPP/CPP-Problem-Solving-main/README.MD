# C++ Language Problems and Solutions

## Overview

This repository is a curated collection of C++ problems and solutions designed for students and developers to practice and enhance their proficiency in C++. The problems are sourced from platforms like CodeChef, GeeksforGeeks, and W3Resources.

> **Note:** I am not the original creator of these problems. This repository simply consolidates them for ease of access and learning, primarily for my students at **United International University (UIU)**, but it is open for anyone interested in C++ programming or competitive coding.

## Usage Guide

### For Students

- The problems are categorized by **difficulty level**, making it easier to progress systematically.
- Each problem is contained in a separate `.cpp` file, with the problem statement included as comments at the top of the file.
- To use:
  1. Read the problem statement and attempt the solution.
  2. Once satisfied with your solution, commit and push your work to your own fork of the repository.
  3. This not only gives you consistent GitHub commits but also helps you develop a learning curve by actively engaging with the problems.

- **Recommendation:** 
  - Keep your forked repository public. This allows peers to view your solutions, fostering collaborative learning and mutual inspiration. Your solutions might also serve as a valuable resource for others seeking guidance.
  - After every week of finishing practice, it is suggested that you try and complete at least one project from the **project list**, which is also categorized by difficulty level. This will reinforce your learning and provide practical experience.

### For Teachers

- If you identify a problem that seems misplaced or wish to add your own problems, feel free to:
  1. Fork this repository.
  2. Add your questions or make modifications in a new branch.
  3. Submit a pull request.

- Teachers at **United International University (UIU)** and beyond are encouraged to contribute **project problems**, categorized by difficulty, for students to work on and practice. Projects help students apply their knowledge in a practical context, improving their understanding and problem-solving skills.

- I plan to set up automatic merging for straightforward updates. For conflicts, manual merging will be performed as needed.

## Contributions

Contributions are welcome! Whether you are a student, teacher, or developer, you can contribute by adding new problems, improving the existing solutions, or enhancing the repository structure.
