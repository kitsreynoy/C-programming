    <h3>According to the 2025 national budget, the Cambodian government aims to collect 31,598 billion riel (around $7.9 billion) in national revenue, comprising, 26,418 billion riel ($6.6 billion) from tax revenue, 3,971 billion riel
  ($992.75 million) from non-tax revenue, and 1,209 billion riel ($302.25 million) from other income sources</h3>
    <p>Hong Vanak, an economist at the Royal Academy of Cambodia, told The Post on May 20 that the increase in revenue reflects a rising level of mining operations, both in terms of the number
  of operations and the returns gained by investors. He believed that conducting further exploration and operations in line with legal frameworks will help ensure sustainable revenue growth.
  “When revenue increases, it gives the government more capacity to invest in public infrastructure, human resources, healthcare, technology and more,” he explained.
   “The government could potentially collect even more tax revenue if business classification updates become more clear and transparent,” he added.</p>
